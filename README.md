# NLP-Text-Classifier

This is a project I worked on during my time as a Data Science Intern at SharkNinja. The goal was to classify consumer reviews of the Shark IQ Robot Vacuum into 50 different pre-identified pain-points during the prototype stage. A random forest algorithm was used (from Python's scikin-learn's library) to achieve this goal. The data was in the form of a CSV file and needed to be first cleaned. Then the data was trained in the traditional 80-20 split of train-test data.
